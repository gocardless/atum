## Contributing

Atum is a fork of [Heroics](https://github.com/interagent/heroics). It is
adapted to consume [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org)-compliant APIs, and output
generated clients into a folder rather than a single file.

We welcome contributions to Atum and discussion about its design and
functionality.  Please open an issue or pull request on this repository to
propose a change.
